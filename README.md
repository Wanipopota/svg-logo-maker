# SVG Logo Maker
  
  ## Description
  This application was developed to enable freelance web developers to create simple logos for their clients and projects, eliminating the need to hire a graphic designer. It uses the Inquirer library to prompt users in the command line for their logo preferences, including the text (up to 3 characters), text color, logo shape (triangle, square, or circle), and shape color. Based on the user's inputs, the application generates an SVG file with the specified design.
